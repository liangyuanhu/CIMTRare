R codes for the methods in the article: Hu, L., Gu, C. Estimation of causal effects of multiple treatments 
in healthcare database studies with rare outcomes. Health Serv Outcomes Res Method (2021). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10742-020-00234-4 

Methods considered for the estimation of causal effects of multiple treatments in healthcare database studies with rare outcomes include: 
Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART), regression adjustment on multivariate spline of generalized propensity scores (RAMS) and 
inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) with multinomial logistic regression or generalized boosted models.
